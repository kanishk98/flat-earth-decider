# flat-earth-decider
npm module for deciding which blocks to request FE server to construct. 

this is more of a storage repo than anything else, just wanted to separate this from the core frontend in github.com/kanishk98/flat-earth. 
every file in `resources/<resource_name>.json` stores the request bodies for primary and aux blocks that need to be written into TF.
